# Doin' it

## Locally

Make sure you have one or more Android device(s) connected to your computer. Below are some tests you can run.

## Remotely on saucelabs.com

Make sure you create a relevant `dev.json` or `prod.json` file in the root of the repo. Production saucelabs.com credentials should look like this:

```
{
    "KEY":"somethingsomething,
    "USER":"filmaj",
    "HOST":"ondemand.saucelabs.com",
    "PORT":80
}
```

Once set up, set a `SAUCE_ENV` environment variable matching the name of the json file containing your credentials.

To run a speedtest with production credentials, do:

    SAUCE_ENV=prod npm test test/sauce-chrome-speedtest.js
